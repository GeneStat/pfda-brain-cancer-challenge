# Brain Cancer Predictive Modeling and Biomarker Discovery Challenge

## Background

This project is a practice and solution of precisionFDA brain cancer challenge. We use data of gene expression and DNA copy number variations to predict survival of brain cancer patients. The challenge detail is shown on precisionFDA website: https://precision.fda.gov/challenges/8

## Milestones

Here goes our plan and milestones:

* Week 0 (2021/11/27 - 2021/12/4): Learn background knowledge about the project, and be familiar with the datasets.
* Week 1 & 2 (2021/12/5 - 2021/12/18): Set up the basic framework of notebook, and try first model (e.g. SVM) on phase 1 data.
* Week 3 & 4 (2021/12/19 - 2022/1/1): Try other different models on phase 1 data, and cross-validate for performance benchmark.
* Week 5 & 6 (2021/1/2 - 2021/1/15): Try models on phase 2 data, and cross-validate for performance benchmark.
* Week 7 & 8 (2021/1/16 - 2021/1/29): Summarize the results and generate the final report.
